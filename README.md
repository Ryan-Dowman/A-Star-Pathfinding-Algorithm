## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the A* Algorithm featuring simple controls and a clean style to showcase the current state pathfinding process as it works away at the process.

## Showcase

One of the primary goals of this project was to make the concept of A* digestible and transparent in nature. Instead of traditional monotone graphs I opted for a more colorful take on the visualisation. The goal was to mimic almost a childlike game such that the process could be accessible to anyone. Alongside this I want for simple controls to favor visual descriptors of the application over written word whenever possible. In short, the inspiration of much of these aesthetic choices was to create an informal visualisation of the process suitable even for aa younger audience.

### Animation:

As seen above another important focus was representing the importance of decision making and showcasing the thought process of the algorithm through color. To do I took inspiration for games often showcase unexplored areas through use of variation in color or brightness. Thus, giving the user, a better understanding of what solutions have been computed or are yet to be computed. Finally, with the completion of the problem it is clear to the audience the efficiency of the algorithm through its ability to leave undesirable paths unexplored and to ultimately showcase its final result.

## Room for Improvements
This projected could easily be extended to include more user interaction such as the ability to move start/end points, the ability to change the size of the grid as well as the ability to modify the animation speed. All these changes would be a simple implementaion of either JS's prompt or for a more clean look the use of a HTML input. I ommitted these features in order to prioritse the demostration focus of the project.
