## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the A* Algorithm featuring intuitive controls and a clean style to showcase the real-time pathfinding process as it works through the problem.

## Showcase

One of the primary goals of this project was to make the concept of A* digestible and visually transparent. Instead of traditional monotone graphs, I opted for a more colorful take on the visualization. The goal was to mimic a childlike game, making the process accessible to anyone. 

Alongside this, I aimed for simple controls, favoring visual descriptors over written explanations whenever possible. The inspiration for these aesthetic choices was to create an informal visualization of the process, suitable even for a younger audience.

### Animation:

As seen above, another important focus was representing the importance of decision-making and showcasing the thought process of the algorithm through color. To achieve this, I took inspiration from games that often depict unexplored areas using variations in color or brightness. This approach provides the user with a clearer understanding of which solutions have been computed and which are yet to be explored. 

Finally, upon completing the problem, it becomes evident how efficient the algorithm is—avoiding undesirable paths and ultimately showcasing the optimal solution.

## Room for Improvement
This project could easily be extended to include more user interaction, such as:
- The ability to move start/end points
- The ability to change the size of the grid
- The ability to modify the animation speed
- Maybe the ability to utilise Dijkstra's algorithm

All these changes would be simple implementations using JavaScript’s `prompt` or, for a cleaner look, HTML inputs. I omitted these features to prioritize the demonstration focus of the project.
